Problem Defination :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
InsightPune addresses the need for a dedicated platform to effectively visualize and analyze the abundant structured data related to Pune city. Despite the wealth of information available on demographics, infrastructure, and culture, there is a noticeable absence of a user-friendly website or application for transforming this data into accessible visual representations. InsightPune aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive and intuitive tool, empowering users, including government, businesses, and residents, to make informed, data-driven decisions based on valuable insights about Pune.
